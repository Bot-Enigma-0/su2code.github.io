Write a brief summary once we are done with most of this.
Generally, the documenation is written with one sentence per line.

## Grant version
Grant will work on:
* "Basics of describing what options are available ..." 
* "Mathematically describe limiters available in SU2"
* helping with any python scripts for postprocessing of empirical study
* general documenation logistics: building, markdown / html specifics, github pull requests

## Basics of describing what options are available and providing some references for them
Do this before diving into the comparisons (which can be a lot more work)
Also we assume that the user will know the theory, and that they are just looking for the limiters that are available in SU2 first.

We may want to link to another place in the docs where they mention that limiters can be activated after a specific number of iterations.

## Why Slope Limiters are used in FVM
* TVD
* Monotonic
* 2nd order accuracy

## Mathematically describe limiters available to user in SU2
Also discuss their properties.

## Empirical comparison of the available limiters on a test problem
