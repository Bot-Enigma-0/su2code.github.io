The regression tests can be run on your local machine by using the Python scripts available in the SU2/TestCases/ directory and the mesh files from the su2code/TestCases and Tutorials repository. See the [Test Cases](/docs_v7/Test-Cases/) page for more information on working with the TestCases repo.

When you are ready to combine your modifications into the develop branch, creating a pull request will automatically run these same regression tests. Your pull request must pass these tests in order to be merged into the develop branch. In the pull request, you will be able to see the state of the tests, and by clicking on links find the details of the test results.
