# Thermodynamic Model #

| Solver | Version | 
| --- | --- |
| `NEMO_EULER`, `NEMO_NAVIER_STOKES` | 7.0.0 |

A rigid-rotor harmonic oscillator (RRHO) two-temperature model is used to model the thermodynamic state of continuum hypersonic flows. Through the independence of the energy levels, the total energy and vibrational--electronic energy per unit volume can be expressed as
$$   \rho e = \sum_s \rho_s \left(e_s^{tr} + e_s^{rot} + e_s^{vib} + e_s^{el} + e^{\circ}_s + \frac{1}{2} \bar{v}^{\top} \bar{v}\right),
$$
and
$$
        \rho e^{ve} = \sum_s \rho_{s} \left(e_s^{vib} + e_s^{el}\right).
$$

Considering a general gas mixture consisting of polyatomic, monatomic, and free electron species, expressions for the energy stored in the translational, rotational, vibrational, and electronic modes are given as
$$
    e^{tr}_s =\begin{cases}
    \frac{3}{2} \frac{R}{M_s} T & \text{for monatomic and polyatomic species,}\\
    0 & \text{for electrons,}
    \end{cases}
$$
$$
    e^{rot}_s =\begin{cases}
    \frac{\xi  }{2} \frac{R}{M_s} T & \text{for polyatomic species,}\\
    0 & \text{for monatomic species and electrons,}
    \end{cases}
$$
where $\xi$ is an integer specifying the number of axes of rotation,
$$
    e^{vib}_s =\begin{cases}
    \frac{R}{M_s} \frac{\theta^{vib}_s}{exp\left( \theta^{vib}_s / T^{ve}\right) - 1} & \text{for polyatomic species,}\\
    0 & \text{for monatomic species and electrons,}
    \end{cases}
$$
where $\theta^{vib}_s$ is the characteristic vibrational temperature of the species, and 


$$
    e^{el}_s =\begin{cases}
    \frac{R}{M_s}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\infty} g_{i,s}{\theta^{el}_{i,s} \exp(-\theta^{el}_{i,s}/T_{ve})}}{\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} g_{i,s} exp(-\theta^{el}_{i,s}/T_{ve})} & \text{for polyatomic and monatomic species,}\\
    \frac{3}{2} \frac{R}{M_s} T^{ve} & \text{for electrons,}
    \end{cases}
$$

where $\theta^{el}_s$ is the characteristic electronic temperature of the species and $g_i$ is the degeneracy of the $i^{th}$ state.

# Finite Rate Chemistry #

| Solver | Version | 
| --- | --- |
| `NEMO_EULER`, `NEMO_NAVIER_STOKES` | 7.0.0 |

The source terms in the species conservation equations are the  volumetric mass production rates which are governed by the forward and backward reaction rates, $R^f$ and $R^b$, for a given reaction $r$, and can be expressed as
$$
    \dot{w}_s = M_s \sum_r (\beta_{s,r} - \alpha_{s,r})(R_{r}^{f} - R_{r}^{b}). 
$$

From kinetic theory, the forward and backward reaction rates are dependent on the molar concentrations of the reactants and products, as well as the forward and backward reaction rate coefficients, $k^f$ and $k^b$, respectively, and can be expressed as
$$
    R_{r}^f = k_{r}^f \prod_s (\frac{\rho_s}{M_s})^{\alpha_{s,r}},
$$
and
$$
    R_{r}^b = k_{r}^b \prod_s (\frac{\rho_s}{M_s})^{\beta_{s,r}}.
$$

For an Arrhenius reaction, the forward reaction rate coefficient can be computed as
$$
    k_{r}^f = C_r(T_r)^{\eta_r} exp\left(- \frac{\epsilon_r}{k_B T_r}\right),
$$
where $C_r$ is the pre-factor, $T_r$ is the rate-controlling temperature for the reaction, $\eta_r$ is an empirical exponent, and $\epsilon_r$ is the activation energy per molecule.

The rate-controlling temperature of the reaction is calculated as a geometric average of the translation-rotational and vibrational-electronic temperatures,
$$
    T_r = (T)^{a_r}(T^{ve})^{b_r}.
$$

The value of he equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$ is expressed as 

$$
    K_{eq} = \exp( A_0 T_m + A_1 + A_2 \log(1/T_m) + A_3 (1/T_m) + A_4 (1/T_m)^2  ),
$$

where $T_m$ is a modified temperature and $A_1 - A_4$ are constants dependent on the reaction. These reaction constants, the rate constrolling temperature and Arrhenius parameters are stored within the fluid model class in SU2 NEMO.

# Vibrational Relaxation #

| Solver | Version | 
| --- | --- |
| `NEMO_EULER`, `NEMO_NAVIER_STOKES` | 7.0.0 |

Vibrational relaxation is computed using a standard Landau-Teller relaxation time with a Park high-temperature correction
$$
     \dot{\Theta}^{tr:ve} = \sum _s \rho_s \frac{de^{ve}_{s}}{dt} = \sum _s \rho_s \frac{e^{ve*}_{s} - e^{ve}_{s}}{\tau_s},
$$
where $\tau_s$ is computed using a combination of the Landau-Teller relaxation time, $\langle \tau_s \rangle_{L-T}$, and a limiting relaxation time from Park, $\tau_{ps}$ using
$$
    \tau_s = \langle \tau_s \rangle_{L-T} + \tau_{ps},
$$
and
$$
    \langle \tau_s \rangle_{L-T} = \frac{\sum_r X_r}{\sum_r X_r/\tau_{sr}}.
$$
The interspecies relaxation times are taken from experimental data from Millikan and White, expressed as
$$
    \tau_{sr} = \frac{1}{P}exp\left[A_sr\left(T^{-1/3} - 0.015\mu_{sr}^{1/4}\right) - 18.42\right].
$$
A limiting relaxation time, $\tau_{ps}$, is used to correct for under-prediction of the Millikan--White model at high temperatures. $\tau_{ps}$ is defined as
$$
    \tau_{ps} = \frac{1}{\sigma_s c_s n},
$$

where $\sigma_s$ is the effective collision~cross-section.

# Transport Coefficients #

| `NEMO_EULER`, `NEMO_NAVIER_STOKES` | 7.0.0 |


Mass, momentum, and  energy transport in fluids are all governed by molecular collisions, and  expressions for these transport properties can be derived from the kinetic theory. The  mass diffusion fluxes, $\mathbf{J}_s$, are computed using Fick's Law of Diffusion:
$$
    \mathbf{J}_s = \rho D_s \nabla(c_s),
$$

where $c_s$ is the species mass fraction and $D_s$ is the species multi-component diffusion coefficient. The  values of $D_s$ are computed as a weighted sum of binary diffusion coefficients between all species in the mixture. These are obtained by solving the Stefan--Maxwell equations under the Ramshaw approximations. The  viscous stress tensor is written as
$$
   \boldsymbol{\sigma} = \mu \left( \nabla \mathbf{u} + \nabla {\mathbf{u}}^\mathsf{T} - \frac{2}{3} \mathbf{I} (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) \right),
$$
where $\mu$ is the mixture viscosity coefficient. The  conduction heat flux for each thermal energy mode, $\mathbf{q}^{k}$, is assumed to be given by Fourierâ€™s Law of heat conduction:
$$
\mathbf{q}^{k} = \kappa^{k}  \nabla(T^k),
$$

where $\kappa^{k}$ is the thermal conductivity associated with energy mode $k$.

$D_s$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$ can be evaluated using either a Wilkes-Blottner-Eucken or Gupta-Yos transport models, with the implemntation details and reocmmendations on use given in the sections below.
